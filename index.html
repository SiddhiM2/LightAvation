        <H3>We take a comprehensive look at India’s growing primary, secondary and higher education system, exploring the history of education in India and how it plans to develop.
        India has a unique education system designed to uphold its nation’s culture, history, values, and customs.
        While traditionally, education in India was reserved mostly for the higher-caste children, new education policies have been aiming to achieve equity in education and the right to education for all children irrespective of social class.    
            
            Here we take a look at the traditional and modern facts surrounding education in India, looking especially at the latest policies that aim to create a more inclusive and contemporary education system.
            We also explore ways you can empower your students’ thirst for knowledge while meeting new classroom demands and needs, across primary, secondary and higher education.
            
        A brief history of India’s education system
            The Gurukul was India’s first system of education. It was a residential schooling system dating back to around 5000 BC, where shisya (student) and guru (teacher) used to reside in the guru’s ashram (home) or in close proximity. This allowed for an emotional bond to be developed prior to the transmission of knowledge. The mode of communication was the ancient Sanskrit language.
            The basis of learning wasn’t only to read books and memorise information, but the well-rounded, holistic development of a child. This included their mental, cognitive, physical and spiritual wellness. Subjects taught were religion, holy scriptures, medicine, philosophy, warfare, statecraft, astrology and more. 
            The emphasis was on developing student’s human values such as self-reliance, right behaviours, empathy, creativity, plus strong moral and ethical behaviours. The aim was that knowledge could later be practically implemented to find solutions to real-life problems. 
            
        The six aims of education for the students of the Gurukul where:
            The acquisition of supreme knowledge: The ultimate purpose of the Gurukul education system was to understand Brahma (God) and the world beyond sensorial pleasures to attain immortality.
            Development of character: Through study of the Vedas (ancient texts), the student developed will-power, a requirement for a good character, which subsequently allowed them to create a more favourable attitude and positive outlook towards life.
            All-rounded development: Learning to withdraw the senses inwards and practice introversion was considered as the ideal method for complete living. This allowed students to become aware of the inner workings of the mind and their responses and reactions while performing various duties in the Gurukul.
            Social virtues: By training body, mind and heart, the student was inspired to only speak truth and refrain from deceit and falsehood.  This was considered to be the highest human virtue. They were also encouraged to believe in giving to charities which made them socially efficient.
            Spiritual development: The ancient texts suggest introversion as the best method for spiritual development, including Yagyas (rituals). Therefore, the student spent time in reflection and isolation from the external world to look entirely within himself to attain self-knowledge and self-realisation.
            Cultural education: One day a year, students offered food to a passerby or a guest. This act was considered a sacrifice equivalent to one’s social and religious duty to another. 
            Facts and statistics about education in India
            Under India’s Right to Education Act 2020, free and compulsory education is ensured to every child between the ages of three to 18.
            
        As of 2020, education in India statistics show that about 26 per cent of the Indian population (1.39 billion) falls into the 0-14 year category, which provides a great opportunity for the primary education sector. 
            Furthermore, 18 per cent of the population, or approximately 500 million, fall into the 15-24 year category, allowing for opportunities for growth across the secondary and higher education institutions in India.  
            Additional Indian education statistics reveal how the literacy ratio of India for adults (15+ years) is 69.3 per cent, with male literacy at 78.8 per cent and female literacy at 59.3 per cent.
            The Indian state with the highest literacy rate is Kerala, at 96.2 per cent as of 2018. 
            The most popular Indian higher education institution is the University of Delhi, followed by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
            India was ranked 34 among the 100 countries in the 2019 English Proficiency Index, allowing for easy delivery of educational material that meets Universal standards.
            Aims for the future of education in India
            In April 2021, India joined the United Nation’s E9 initiative, whose purpose is to create an initiative on digital learning and skills, targeting marginalised children and youth, especially girls.
            According to Union Budget 2021-22, the Indian government allocated an expenditure budget of US7.56 billion for school education and literacy.
            
        By 2030, it’s estimated that India’s higher education system will have more than 20 universities among the global top 200 universities. It’s also thought that it will be among the top five countries in the world in terms of research output, with an annual research and development (R&D) spend of US$140 billion.  </H3>

       <PRE><h1><U>MAIN PROBLEMS IN INDIAN EDUCATION</U></h1></PRE> 

       <PRE><H3>The following are the main problems faced in the progress of education:

        1. Lack of funds:
        The lack of sufficient funds is the main problem in the development of education. Outlay for education in Five Year Plans has been decreasing. Due to insufficient funds most educational institutions lack infrastructure, science equipment and libraries etc. Due to this reason, desired results cannot be achieved.
        
        2. Expensive higher education:
        University, professional and technical education has become costly in India. Fee structure of technical and professional institutes like IIM’s is quite high IIM’s charge Rs. 2 lakh per semester for MBA classes. It is beyond the reach of common man. Privatization of higher education has led to the growth of profit hungry entrepreneurs. Now a day’s higher education is much costly affair.
        
        3. Neglect of Indian languages:
        The medium of instruction particularly in science subjects is English. So rural students who are not well versed in English, cannot study science properly in English. They suffer a lot; Indian languages are still under developed. Standard publications are not available in Indian language.
        
        4. Problem of Brain drain:
        When intelligent, talented and deserving candidates do not get suitable jobs in the country, they prefer to go abroad for seeking jobs. So our country is deprived of good talent. This phenomenon is called ‘Brain drain’.
        
        5. Mass illiteracy:
        Despite constitutional directives and economic planning we are not able to achieve cent percent literacy. -Even now 35 percent people remain illiterate. In India, the number of illiterates is almost one-third of the total illiterates in the world. Advanced countries are 100% literate; the position in India is quite dismal.
        
        6. Wastage of resources:
        Our education system is based on General Education. The dropout rate is very high in primary and secondary level. Most of the students in 6-14 age groups leave the school before completing their education. It leads to wastage of 5nancial and human resources.
        
        7. General education oriented:
        Our educational system is of General Education in nature. Development of technical and vocational education is quite unsatisfactory. So our education is unproductive. Hence number of educated unemployed persons is increasing day by day. This has become a great concern for Govt.
        
        8. Problems of primary education:
        Our primary education is ridden with too many problems. Large number of primary schools has no buildings what to talk of basic facilities like drinking water, urinals and electricity, furniture and study materials etc. Large numbers of primary schools are single teacher schools and many schools are even without teachers. So the drop rate is very high and a cause of concern. Concluding, we can say that there is quantitative expansion of education but in qualitative development we are still lagging behind.</H3>
